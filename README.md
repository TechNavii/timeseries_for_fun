## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (3.12 recommended)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- 4GB+ RAM (8GB recommended for transformer models)

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository (when available on GitHub)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/timeseries_for_fun.git
cd timeseries_for_fun

# Make startup script executable
chmod +x start_app.sh

# Run the application
./start_app.sh
```

The script automatically:
- Creates a virtual environment
- Installs all dependencies
- Initializes the database
- Launches the GUI at http://localhost:8501

### 2. Configure API Keys (Optional but Recommended)

Edit the `.env` file to enable advanced features:

```bash
# OpenAI API for news sentiment analysis
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Model selection (application is locked to gpt-5-mini)
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5-mini
```

Get your OpenAI key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### 3. Manual Setup (Alternative)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Install transformer models (for Chronos/PatchTST)
pip install torch transformers neuralforecast

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📊 Using the Application

### Main Interface

1. **Select Market**: Choose US, Japan, or Both
2. **Enter Stock Symbol**:
   - US: AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, TSLA, etc.
   - Japan: Enter just the number (7203 for Toyota, 7974 for Nintendo)
     - Automatically converts to proper format (7974 → 7974.T)
     - Dynamically discovers company names (e.g., 7974.T → 任天堂)
3. **Configure Settings**:
   - Date range for historical data
   - Prediction horizon (1-30 days)
   - Model type (6 options available)
4. **Get Predictions**:
   - Click "Fetch Data" to load historical prices
   - Click "Fetch News" for sentiment analysis (optional)
   - Click "Make Prediction" for AI predictions

### Model Selection Guide

| Model | Best For | Speed | Accuracy | Device Support |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **XGBoost** | Short-term, general purpose | Fast | High | CPU |
| **LightGBM** | Large datasets, speed priority | Fastest | High | CPU |
| **Random Forest** | Robustness, interpretability | Moderate | Good | CPU |
| **Ensemble** | Best accuracy, combines all | Slow | Highest | CPU |
| **Chronos** | Zero-shot, no training needed | Fast* | Very High | CUDA/MPS*/CPU |
| **PatchTST** | Long-term predictions | Fast* | State-of-art | CUDA/MPS/CPU |

*With GPU acceleration (CUDA or Apple Silicon MPS)

## 🎯 How It Works

### Prediction Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches historical price data from Yahoo Finance
2. **Feature Engineering**: Generates 150+ technical indicators
3. **News Analysis**: OpenAI analyzes sentiment from 15+ news sources
4. **Model Prediction**: Selected ML/transformer model makes prediction
5. **Sentiment Adjustment**: News sentiment adjusts final prediction (±2% max)
6. **Confidence Scoring**: Provides uncertainty estimates

### News Sentiment Integration

The system integrates news sentiment intelligently:
- Fetches news from Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ, Financial Times, etc.
- **Japanese Stock Enhancement**:
  - Prioritizes Japanese financial sources (Nikkei, Toyo Keizai, Diamond Online, etc.)
  - Requires 70%+ Japanese sources for Japanese stocks
  - Uses discovered Japanese company names for better search results
- OpenAI GPT-5-mini analyzes sentiment (-1 to +1 score)
- Adjusts predictions: `final_price = ml_prediction + (current_price × sentiment_impact)`
- Maximum impact: ±2% to maintain stability

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
```bash
lsof -i :8501
kill -9 <PID>
```

2. **Module Import Errors**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Chronos on Apple Silicon (macOS)**
- Automatically uses MPS acceleration on M1/M2/M3 Macs
- Falls back to statistical model only on Intel Macs
- No action needed

4. **News Fetching Issues**
- Verify OpenAI API key in .env
- Check API quota/credits
- For Japanese stocks: Ensure internet access to Yahoo Finance Japan

5. **Data Persistence**
- Data is automatically cached across model switches
- Use "Clear All Caches" button in sidebar if needed
- Caches include: stock data, news analysis, and predictions
